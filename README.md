BDD (Behavioral Driven Development) approach is used in this project to write the test cases development on the basis of the behaviour of software functionalities. These tests written inside the feature file which use Gherkin language. We must have the following dependencies in our computer system:

Java Eclipse 
Cucumber 
Eclipse Plugin
Selenium 
Junit or TestNg 
cucumber-junit

After the project was compiled it was run through Jenkins to test the CICD approach. The github repository will be called from the Jenkins platform by creating a pipeline and by executing the Jenkins file inside the github repo which is written in Groovy to generate the cucumber report.
